# Designing a GUI in rust with iced

I'm writing this as a tutorial, but i am still learning rust and iced so there's a high probability that i could be doing something entirely wrong. While i was using the library i noticed a dearth tutorials so hopefully this helps fill that void.

I am going to go through some of the various thing's that i struggled with or I wish were better documented while I was building my GUI.

## Contents
- Getting Started
- Setting the Theme
- Handling Events
- Creating a Custom Widget
- Creating a Custom Component
- Styling Elements

## Notes
- The [iced_native](https://docs.rs/iced_native/latest/iced_native/) documents are often far more helpful for understanding what to do than the *iced* docs.
- The [examples](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/master/examples) directory is enormously helpful.
- the [discord](https://bit.ly/rust-community) is a great resource as well and the library maintainers are very active.
