# Articles

Article on the difficulty of ever finishing a personal project that you've started for yourself

I've barely used airtable but found this article super interesting they basically bought a company for tens of millions just to kill it. Is it even going to be worth doing this in the future.

It doesn't make any sense to me how zapier has maintained such a huge company they're basically a nice interface to lambda function's. I mean of course there's more they've done a ton of engineering work but it just seems like there should be way more people in this space

TLDR; Bambu Labs just works and is better
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38771452

This one i thought was sort of interesting it's reviewing why it's so hard to find more advanced material my thought is that it's because it's not packaged in the format that most people are looking for. There's ton's of highly advanced data structures and algo's books they're often just not as reader friendly as "Learn go in a week"
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38804603

Interesting conversation about apps people built for themselves
